# Handoff — 2026-09-19-market-display-profile-wave1b

**Last updated:** 2026-09-19T16:32:05Z
**Branch:** feat/market-display-profile-wave1b
**PR:** https://github.com/systevio/open-mercato/pull/7 (draft)
**Current phase/step:** complete - all fourteen Steps done
**Last commit:** b8f3fe9ad — style(catalog): price kind warning uses the current Alert status API

## What just happened
- Every Tasks row is `done`. The final gate is green: the whole `validation.commands` list in order, plus the
  design-system pass, with `origin/develop` (`63bebfea9`) merged in.
- `yarn test` needs `TMPDIR` outside the repository on this host, or the `@open-mercato/cli` suite fails on an
  artifact of where cezar puts temp dirs. Re-run green with `--env-mode=loose`.
- UI verification was attempted on a fresh slot database and could not complete - the dev server wedges on a route
  compile error this branch does not touch. There are no screenshots; the PR keeps `needs-qa`.

## Next concrete action
- Nothing on the implementation. The PR is left as a **draft** deliberately, per the task's instruction that the
  release step of this workflow merges and publishes it.
- For whoever picks up QA: the environment needs a working dev server. `apps/mercato/.env` must point at the slot
  database (`omw`'s initializer does not set it), and the `language-subtag-registry` import-attribute error on
  `/login` needs resolving independently of this branch.

## Blockers / open questions
- No implementation blockers. One open item for a human: no screenshots exist, so nobody has seen these screens
  render. The behavior is unit-tested against the US template, the EU template and the no-profile path.

## Environment caveats
- Dev runtime runnable: partially. It starts and reports ready, but `/login` never finishes compiling
  (`ERR_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING` on `language-subtag-registry`). Ports drift from the `PORT` in `.env`.
- Browser / UI checks: attempted and unable to run. Full account in `final-gate-checks.md`.
- Database/migration state: this slot now runs its own **fresh** database (`om_task2`, port 5433), not the shared
  instance. A plain `omw up` would rewrite `.env` back to the shared one. This run adds no migration of its own.

## Worktree
- Path: /srv/om/repos/open-mercato/.ai/cezar/worktrees/fac8bef7-a46a-43e6-ad82-2f5281f491d1
- Created this run: no (the cezar task worktree is reused)
